Description:

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a singly linked list in C, offering a set of common operations and utilities for managing a list of student records. The included linked list library (lists.h) allows for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of linked list elements.

Key Features:

Add Students: Easily add student records with usernames and grades to the linked list.
Perform Operations: Choose from a menu to perform various operations on the linked list, including sorting, reversing, finding duplicates, and calculating the average grade.
User-Friendly Interface: The project features a simple command-line interface with a menu-driven system, making it accessible for users to interact with the linked list.
Usage Instructions:

Compile: Use a C compiler to compile the main program (main.c) and the linked list library (lists.h).

Run: Execute the compiled program, and follow the on-screen menu to add students and perform operations on the linked list.

Explore and Learn: Use this project as a learning resource to understand linked list operations and enhance your knowledge of dynamic data structures in C.
